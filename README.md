# Python_Minesweeper ðŸ’£
Welcome, this is my first bigger project.

# Basically 
itâ€™s a minesweeper game with the same rules. It was a great experience to learn a bit of class/object programming in python.
The biggest problem in this project was the algorithm to discover all places with 0 near bombs. But I finally did it, and I think there would be a better method for this and I think itâ€™s not optimal.

# Rules
write position of row and columns, if you dig the bomb then you lose, if you have dug every cell without digging the bomb then you win. you will never

# Future plans
For sure try to discover the 0's with a more optimal algorithm. 
Try to make a clickable display and show in a separate window.
Make a flag the bomb system.

# Thanks ðŸ’™
Have fun with testing this, and give me your opinion or some feedback if you saw something that I could do better or if you have some better ideas to add in this project.
