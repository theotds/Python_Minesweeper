# Python_Minesweeper ðŸ’£
Welcome, this is my first bigger project.

So basically itâ€™s a minesweeper game with the same rules. The board is shown in the command prompt, and you write the coordinates (row columns) to dig. For this moment there is no flagging system to mark where the bombs are. I also did a system that the first move will be always a place where there are no bombs near.

Have fun with testing this, and give me your opinion or some feedback if you saw something that I could do better.
